# Genome-assembly-using-overlapping-graph
this repository contains a Python-based pipeline for assembling the PhiX genome using:
1. A **naive overlap graph** method
2. A **k-mer-optimized** approach with optional error correction.

##contents
-`Genome_assemply.py` : Runs the naive overlap approach
-`kmer-improved.ipynb` :Implements the k-mer filtering, error correction,and global greedy merging
-`sequence.fasta` :the Phix genome.
